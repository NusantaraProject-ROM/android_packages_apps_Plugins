# POSP SystemUI Plugins

This repository (currently) houses 4 different SystemUI Volume Panel Plugins.
To build and use these as intended, you may need to pick some changes from our [frameworks/base](https://github.com/PotatoProject/frameworks_base).

Then, compile the following modules:
```
AospPanel
CompactPanel
OreoPanel
TiledPanel
```

**Please refrain from altering packagenames/classpaths and Copyright headers**
Respect original works, we accept contributions via [Gerrit Code Review](review.potatoproject.co) :)
Feel free to track this repository directly!

Special thanks to Alex (treydev) for the ViewTreeInspector animation trick!
